            8/25/23 - Today, we attempted to show the importance of continuing to try again after failure through a group exercise. We connected pipes together as a team and tried leading it into a bucket. Obviously, it took more than one try as we had to find out how we would get it done in the most efficient, easiest way, but in the end, we successfully completed the task after realizing that we needed to fix a couple of problems involving the speed of the marble, and the slope of the pipes.

            9/11/23 - So far, we've just started on working on our Rube Goldberg Project. We came up with a base idea for the project, although the build seems a lot harder than we had expected. Since our last journal entry, we have learned how to CAD, which was what we used to plan out our project.

            9/25/23 - Finally, we were able to finish our Rube Goldberg project after a week. It took a lot of trial and error in order to realize that our draft wouldn't be accurate enough to actually carry out the project. While we were doing it, we realized we would need to either improvise on some parts or just completely take it out. Another problem was the size, since our draft wasn't too realistic to scale. So, we used a lot more tape than expected to actually hold it up, because it wasn't as stable as we wanted it to be. Eventually, we fixed all our problems after understanding how to work out our lever. It was an incredibly fun project to do, and we learned a lot about a small portion of the engineering world.

            9/29/23 - Today, we took the time to understand what were the specific parts of the computer. We had decomposed the structure of the computer, and took the time to reassemble it again. Doing this helped us learn what was inside the PC, and how it works. Recently, we have been learning more about computer engineering, which is why we had this type of activity.

            10/4/23 - We decided to take on another challenge of creating a prosthetic hand. The materials we had were cardboard, tape, string, and rubber bands. First off, we thought of the base of the actual project. We deicded that the rubber bands would be used to pull the fingers that were created off the limited cardboard we had. So, we created a minimilastic, simple design that still incorporated all the materials given to us. We faced the challenge of not being able to actually use the hand without using the other hand, since our prosthetic would just follow the hand that would pull on the bands. So, we decided to create something that latched on to our wrist and stayed there so that it would actually be able to carry something with only one hand. It took some time, but eventually we created a very simple, useful design.

            10/20/23 - Today, we finally launched our rocket that we made from a soda bottle. We had expected it to be a complete fail, but to our surprise, it had an airtime a lot longer than we had expected. If anything, it did a lot better than most of the other rockets. We went with a basic design of simple adding some wings on the side of the bottle, and finishing it with a cone at the top to make it look somewhat like an actual rocket. We also kept in mind to not make it too heavy, which led to the conclusion of making our cone out of paper. Since our expectations were so low, we were pretty surprised seeing it go so far. This is the video of the rocket.
