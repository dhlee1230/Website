            8/25/23 (#1)- Today, we attempted to show the importance of continuing to try again after failure through a group exercise. We connected pipes together as a team and tried leading it into a bucket. Obviously, it took more than one try as we had to find out how we would get it done in the most efficient, easiest way, but in the end, we successfully completed the task after realizing that we needed to fix a couple of problems involving the speed of the marble, and the slope of the pipes.

            9/11/23 (#2) - So far, we've just started on working on our Rube Goldberg Project. We came up with a base idea for the project, although the build seems a lot harder than we had expected. Since our last journal entry, we have learned how to CAD, which was what we used to plan out our project.

            9/25/23 (#3) - Finally, we were able to finish our Rube Goldberg project after a week. It took a lot of trial and error in order to realize that our draft wouldn't be accurate enough to actually carry out the project. While we were doing it, we realized we would need to either improvise on some parts or just completely take it out. Another problem was the size, since our draft wasn't too realistic to scale. So, we used a lot more tape than expected to actually hold it up, because it wasn't as stable as we wanted it to be. Eventually, we fixed all our problems after understanding how to work out our lever. It was an incredibly fun project to do, and we learned a lot about a small portion of the engineering world.

            9/29/23 (#4) - Today, we took the time to understand what were the specific parts of the computer. We had decomposed the structure of the computer, and took the time to reassemble it again. Doing this helped us learn what was inside the PC, and how it works. Recently, we have been learning more about computer engineering, which is why we had this type of activity.

            10/4/23 (#5) - We decided to take on another challenge of creating a prosthetic hand. The materials we had were cardboard, tape, string, and rubber bands. First off, we thought of the base of the actual project. We deicded that the rubber bands would be used to pull the fingers that were created off the limited cardboard we had. So, we created a minimilastic, simple design that still incorporated all the materials given to us. We faced the challenge of not being able to actually use the hand without using the other hand, since our prosthetic would just follow the hand that would pull on the bands. So, we decided to create something that latched on to our wrist and stayed there so that it would actually be able to carry something with only one hand. It took some time, but eventually we created a very simple, useful design.

            10/20/23 (#6) - Today, we finally launched our rocket that we made from a soda bottle. We had expected it to be a complete fail, but to our surprise, it had an airtime a lot longer than we had expected. If anything, it did a lot better than most of the other rockets. We went with a basic design of simple adding some wings on the side of the bottle, and finishing it with a cone at the top to make it look somewhat like an actual rocket. We also kept in mind to not make it too heavy, which led to the conclusion of making our cone out of paper. Since our expectations were so low, we were pretty surprised seeing it go so far. This is the video of the rocket.

            10/26/23 (#7) - We have now moved on to Environmental Engineering. In order to learn more about it, we did a project as we do for each section. This time, our goal was to learn to filter water with the provided materials: rocks, sand, cotton, two parts of a bottle, and dirty water. Of course; we had clean water to actually clear up the previous dirt on the bottles. Our plan was to first stack the start of our filtering system with cotton. Then, we stacked a bit of sand, and finally ended it off with the rocks. After out first try, we realized that it took quite a long time and it wasn't filtering as well as we thought it would. So, we decided to restart all over again and try to use less materials so that the water could go through. Unfortunately, we squished the cotton too into the bottle that it was essentially clogged, and not filtering as we wanted it to. So, we had to wait quite a while, drip after drip, to see how the filter would turn out this time, just for it to end the same as it did previously. Obviously we were pretty disappointed, given that class ended with us not feeling satisfied with our result, but we did understand some of the mistakes we were doing.

            11/3/23 (#8) - This week's focus is on Electrical Enginerring. Up to this point, I've had no knowledge on the important factors to get an electrical system running. Now I have gained knowledge on these things, like how a resistor works and the units of certain things. We used tinkercad again to visualize a breadboard and use the functions of resistors and LED's on it. It was quite fun to play around with, as it was a new challenge to get the LED's to light up. I learned what parts go into the negative side and what goes into the positive, and ultimately found the way to complete the labs given. It seemed very complex at first, but I realized that it was rather easy, and finished it with a complete understanding of what I was doing. Although I had to redo it since the LEDs weren't lit up, I found my mistakes easily and redid the assignment.

            12/1/23 (#9) - We just finished up business engineering. This was a short yet fun section, as we had a similar activity to the show Shark Tank. We made a presentation on the item we came up with, which was the Anti-Fog glasses for us. Essentially, we would pump out air to defog the glasses whenever there was something on the glasses, like when you eat. Although not everyone in the world wears glasses, we thought this could be useful for those that struggled with this problem, since one of the members in our group actually found this bothersome. I believe it was a pretty good idea, and it was fun presenting it to the class.

  <li>Answer to question 1: The weight of my bridge was 32.7g.</li>
  <li>Answer to question 2: The weight held by the bridge was 447g.</li>
  <li>Answer to question 3: The ratio of the bridge to the weight it held was 13:1.</li>
  <li>Answer to question 4: The heaviest part of our bridge was most likely the sides. Although we tried to balance out the weight throughout the bridge equally, we ended up putting most of the pieces on the sides. The spaghettis being stacked as an X shape let it to being heavy.</li>
  <li>Answer to question 5: The design of the bridge came from logic. We realized we needed a more efficient yet basic design given the amount of spaghettis. So, we came up with the idea of a flat bridge but also having a design that would help give it weight with the X shapes.</li>
  <li>Answer to question 6: The design actually worked a lot worse than intended, as during our practice run we had the same design yet it got a lot farther than the one we recreated as the final. We had set the expectation to the level that was shown during the practice run, and we failed to meet it as it snapped very easily this time when it mattered. </li>
  <li>Answer to question 7: The point of failure in the bridge was most likely either the glue was put on less carefully, or the sides carried too much weight, causing the middle to snap. It was not expected, since it had worked before so we thought we would have the same outcome. </li>
  <li>Answer to question 8: To improve our bridge, we should have probably put more spaghettis on areas where it actually mattered, compared to what we actually did in leaving the middle area a bit open. To stop this, we would have had to focus more on getting the equal weights precisely for the middle and the sides.</li>
